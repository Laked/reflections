When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working on a team or when the local terminal may be temporary or in case it may be destroyed.  Also, working from a public remote repo is public, so there that.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may have branches that aren't on the remote repository and you wouldn't want to overwrite them.
